# U3-Objectoriented-programming
Third java project in objectoriented programming which was the first course at Malmö University in Computer Systems Developer.

This is the third project we had in Objectoriented programming in Malmö University at Computer Systems Developer. This is the first project where we could pair-programme, which me and a classmate Josef Zakaria did. There is also a report including a classdiagram and sequence diagram.

This is a old project, i just added it to GitHub.
